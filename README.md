# Gaussian Mixture Models: clustering unlabeled data

Here is a simple implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster unlabeled data. [Sklearn already does this,](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html)- this is simply for my own interest and certainly not for actual use.

Resulting clustering for 3 hidden clusters, modeling 3 clusters:
